# Moonboard-Analysis
The Moonboard (moonboard.com) is a training tool for rock climbers. It has a standard set of holds and a standard angle at 40 degrees across the world.
Climbers anywhere can collaborate, try climbs out that other climbers have made, or make their own. 

The goal of this project is to engineer some features and attempt to predict the difficulty of a climb given only the holds that the climber chose for the climb.
